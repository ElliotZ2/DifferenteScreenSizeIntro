    <h1>Part 2</h1>
    <p>Create an html file that has the elements: h1 heading, 3 paragraphs, 1 image and one link.</p>
    <p>Apply CSS to your HTML page so that it should look different when viewed on a smaller screen size ( less than 600px,
        with a yellowish background color) and another view on a larger screen
        size ( greater than 600px, with a light blue background color).</p>
    <p>Add an HTML comment in which you describe how you accomplished this task and what makes the same webpage look different when viewing it at different screen sizes.</p>

    <!--In order to make the same webpage look different when viewing it with different screen sizes,
    I had to create a css file that saw whether the window size was greater than or
    less than 600 and it would change the background color of all elements accordingly-->
